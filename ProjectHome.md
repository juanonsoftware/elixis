Elixis is an encryption library made in C#. You can encrypt and decrypt data using AES,TripleDES and MD5 algorithms so far, other algorithms may be imported in future.

  * **AES (Rijndael)**

> The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) officially announced that Rijndael,
> designed by Joan Daemen and Vincent Rijmen, would be the new Advanced Encryption Standard.
> The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is the current encryption standard,
> intended to be used by  the U.S. Government organisations to protect sensitive
> (and even secret and top secret) information. It is also becoming a global standard
> for commercial software and hardware that use encryption. It is a block cipher which
> uses 128-bit, 192-bit or 256-bit keys. Rijndael is very secure and has no known weaknesses.

  * **TripleDES**

> Triple DES is three times slower than regular DES but can be billions of
> times more secure if used properly. Triple DES is simply another mode of DES operation.
> It takes three 64-bit keys, for an overall key length of 192 bits.
> The procedure for encryption is exactly the same as regular DES, but it is
> repeated three times, hence the name Triple DES. The data is encrypted with
> the first key, encrypted with the second key, and finally encrypted again
> with the third key. Triple DES enjoys much wider use than DES because DES
> is so easy to break with today's rapidly advancing technology.

  * **MD5**

> In cryptography, MD5 (Message-Digest algorithm 5) is a widely used,partially  insecure cryptographic hash function with a 128-bit hash value.
> As an Internet standard (RFC 1321), MD5 has been employed in a wide variety of security applications, and
> is also commonly used to check the integrity of files. An MD5 hash is typically expressed as a 32 digit hexadecimal number.
> MD5 was designed by Ron Rivest in 1991 to replace an earlier hash function, MD4. In 1996, a flaw was found with the design of MD5.
